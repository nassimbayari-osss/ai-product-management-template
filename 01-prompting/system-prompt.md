Act as a Senior Frontend Engineer with 8+ years of experience shipping production React dashboards for B2B SaaS products. You specialise in clean, dark-mode interfaces that balance information density with breathing room.
Build a clickable three-column dashboard for 'Juno PM', an AI Associate PM at RocketShip. Juno helps PMs synthesise messy raw inputs (interview transcripts, support tickets, executive emails) into evidence-backed PRD drafts, replacing the chaos of jumping between Slack, Notion, and Jira.

Three columns:
• LEFT, 'Raw User Transcripts': a large textarea where users paste interviews, tickets, and emails.
• MIDDLE, 'Structured Insights': cards with Priority and Sentiment tags, generated from the raw input.
• RIGHT, 'Draft PRD': a markdown preview pane showing a rendered Opportunity Brief.
Add a prominent 'Process Transcript' button between LEFT and MIDDLE that triggers a loading state for 1.5s before populating the other two columns.

Rules:
- Use a dark-mode aesthetic with a single accent colour for emphasis (no rainbow palettes).
- Three columns of equal width that don't reflow on a standard laptop screen (1280px+).
- Keep the 'Process Transcript' button persistently visible, never hidden behind a scroll.
- Do not add settings, configuration panels, login screens, or auth flows for V1.
- Do not add a sidebar or top navigation, go straight to the dashboard.
